### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Love to Code, problem solving and thinking out of the matrix.

I stand out for being a programmer and cybersecurity analyst, so I am constantly updating myself with new technologies. I like to mess around with code flaws, exploits and vulnerabilities and look for new ones. My goal is to have a good time learning, studying and working.
